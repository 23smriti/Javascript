Object: entities having state and behaviour. (properties & methods)
JS objects have a special property called prototype.
Prototype is itslef a reference of an object having methods and entities

Ex- array is an object ,****** ----typeof array is object ---********
We can set prototype using _ _ proto _ _

Class: Class is a program-code template for creating objects
Those objects will have some state(variables) & some behaviour (functions) inside it.
Class is the blueprint of objects

class MyClass{
    constructor() {..}
    myMethod() {..}
}

constructor is a special method.
Automatically invoked by new , during the creation of an object
Purpose: To initialize the object i.e. to initialize any properties during object creation

We can pass arguments to constructor as well

Inheritance: passing down properties & methods from parent class to child class.

class Parent {

}

class Child extends Parent {

}
*If Child & Parent have same method, child’s
method will be used. [Method Overriding]

Super Keyword: The super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to acess the parent's properties and methods
super( args ) // calls Parent‘s constru
super.parentMethod( args )
